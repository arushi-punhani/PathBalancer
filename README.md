# PathBalancer - Drivable Area Segmentation

A real-time semantic segmentation pipeline for autonomous driving that classifies Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations into drivable and non-drivable areas using the NuScenes dataset.

## Overview

PathBalancer processes BEV (Bird's Eye View) grid representations of traffic scenes and uses a UNet neural network to perform semantic segmentation. The project outputs a real-time inference pipeline that produces a binary or multi-class mask representing "Drivable" vs. "Non-Drivable" regions, enabling autonomous vehicles to safely navigate their environment.

### Dataset

This project uses the **NuScenes v1.0-mini dataset** (`v1.0-mini.tgz`). The mini dataset is a condensed version of the full NuScenes dataset, containing approximately 404 samples suitable for development and testing.

**Dataset Source:** [NuScenes Dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/)

- **Size:** Approximately 350 samples for training, 54 samples for validation
- **Format:** BEV grid representations (200x200 pixels)
- **Classes:** Semantic segmentation for drivability assessment
  - **Drivable:** Safe areas for vehicle navigation
  - **Non-Drivable:** Obstacles, hazards, pedestrians, vehicles
  - **Additional Classes:** Fine-grained segmentation for specific hazard types

## Setup & Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- NuScenes devkit
- TQDM (for progress bars)

### Installation Steps

1. **Extract the NuScenes dataset:**
   ```bash
   tar -xzf v1.0-mini.tgz
   ```

2. **Run preprocessing:**
   ```bash
   python preprocess_dataset.py
   ```
   This will create processed data directories:
   - `processed_data/input_bev/` - Input BEV representations
   - `processed_data/ground_truth/` - Ground truth labels

3. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Evaluate results:**
   ```bash
   python testModel.py
   ```

## Key Features

### Real-Time Inference Pipeline
Optimized for autonomous driving applications with emphasis on inference speed and accuracy balance.

### Drivability Classification
- **Drivable Areas:** Safe regions where vehicles can navigate
- **Non-Drivable Areas:** Obstacles, curbs, pedestrians, and other hazards

### Weighted Loss Function
The model uses weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance and emphasize critical drivability decisions:
- Non-drivable (obstacles/hazards): 10x penalty - critical for safety
- Drivable (safe road): 5x penalty
- Other regions: Weighted appropriately to ensure robust segmentation

This weighting prevents the model from converging to trivial "all drivable" predictions and ensures safe autonomous navigation.

### Model Architecture
- **Input:** 3-channel BEV representation (200×200)
- **Layers:** 3 encoder blocks, 2 decoder blocks with skip connections
- **Output:** Binary or multi-class drivability mask (200×200)
- **Optimization:** Designed for real-time inference with minimal latency

### Data Pipeline
- Files are stored as NumPy arrays (`_x.npy` for input, `_y.npy` for labels)
- Automatic train/validation split (350/54 samples)
- Batch size: 4 for training, 8 for validation
- No shuffling on validation set for reproducibility

## Usage

### Training from Scratch
```bash
python train.py
```
Saves best model checkpoint to `best_loss.txt`

### Running Sanity Checks
```bash
python testModelSanity.py
python check_my_tensors.py
```

### Counting Dataset Samples
```bash
python file_count.py
```

### Evaluation Metrics

**1. Semantic Segmentation Accuracy**

- Training/validation split is sequential (not randomized for reproducibility)
- Checkpoints resume from previous best validation loss if available
- Repository should be publicly accessible during evaluation
